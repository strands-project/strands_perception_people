\mainpage fovis library API documentation

\section introduction Introduction

Fovis is a visual odometry library that estimates the 3D motion of a camera
using a source of depth information for each pixel.  It's original
implementation is described in the following paper:

\li Visual Odometry and Mapping for Autonomous Flight Using an RGB-D Camera.  <i>Albert S. Huang, Abraham Bachrach, Peter Henry, Michael Krainin, Daniel Maturana, Dieter Fox, and Nicholas Roy</i>

\section build_requirements Build requirements

Fovis is intended to be relatively portable.  There are two major requirements
for building and using the software:
\li <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen 3</a>
\li A CPU supporting Intel SSE2.

\section usage_requirements Usage requirements

For portability reasons, the actual library itself is sensor agnostic and
provides no data acquisition capabilities.  To use fovis, your program must
acquire data on its own and pass it through to the fovis API.  Some examples
are provided with the source code.

Effective use of fovis for visual odometry requires the following:
\li A source of 8-bit grayscale camera images.
\li A <em>camera calibration</em> for the images that provides an accurate mapping between
image pixel coordinates \f$(u, v)\f$ and 3D rays \f$(X, Y, Z)\f$ in the camera's Cartesian coordinate frame.
\li A <em>depth source</em> for each image.  A depth source must be able to
provide a metric depth estimate for as many pixels in the camera image as
possible.

Fovis provides built-in support for the following types of depth sources:
\li An RGB-D camera such as the Microsoft Kinect.
\li Calibrated stereo cameras.

You can also create your own depth sources using the Fovis API and adapt it to other sensor types.

\section getting_started Getting started

The best way to get started is to look through the examples provided with the
source code in the \c examples/ directory.

Next, look through the Fovis C++ API.  The primary class of interest
is \ref fovis::VisualOdometry.
